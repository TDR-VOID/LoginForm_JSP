# JSP User Authentication Demo

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple web-based login form for user authentication. The web application is designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of user login functionality. Built using Java Server Pages (JSP) and the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE), this project serves as a practical example of integrating server-side scripting with a relational database. The application is hosted locally using the Apache Tomcat server, making it easy to deploy and test in a development environment.
